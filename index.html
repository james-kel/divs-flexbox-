            <p>"The human body is not a thing or substance, given, but a continuous creation. The human body is an
                energy system which is never a complete structure; never static; is in perpetual inner self-construction
                and self-destruction; we destroy in order to make it new." ~ Norman O. Brown

            Rather than trying to have the answers quickly, focus on asking good questions to yourself and observing the
            process of consciousness which struggles with the questions. Be patient and enjoy contemplating reality
            rather than trying to reach some imagined end.

            When it comes to dancing, it's real simple: don't try to be a "good dancer" or to impress anyone or to look
            cool. Dance like you don't give a damn and having the most fun. That's how you win at dancing. The one who
            wins is the one who is having the most fun and doesn't care about being "good" at it.
